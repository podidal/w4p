- [ ] Implement multi-room support

### UI/UX
- [x] Basic interface implementation
- [x] Audio quality controls
- [x] Performance monitoring
- [x] Connection quality indicators
- [ ] Add dark mode support
- [ ] Implement device grouping
- [ ] Add custom device naming

### Performance
- [x] Buffer health monitoring
- [x] CPU usage tracking
- [x] Data rate monitoring
- [ ] Implement adaptive buffer size
- [ ] Add network condition monitoring
- [ ] Optimize memory usage

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for audio processing

- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Cross-device compatibility tests

## Future Enhancements
1. Multi-room audio synchronization
2. Audio equalizer
3. Device profiles
4. Network topology visualization
5. Audio source selection (mic, file, system audio)

## Known Issues
1. High latency with large buffer sizes
2. Occasional connection drops in crowded Bluetooth environments
3. High CPU usage with no compression

## Task Assignment
- Audio Processing: TBD
- Bluetooth Connection: TBD
- UI/UX: TBD
- Testing: TBD

## Notes
- Regular testing needed for different Android versions
- Consider WebRTC as fallback for devices without Bluetooth
- Monitor battery usage on receiver devices
